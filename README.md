# peer-assessment-app
## Project description
Group projects are often not balanced, some do a lot more work than others and some team members try to get the grades without putting in much effort. Moreover, the professor has no way of knowing how the work is being distributed and cannot fairly grade the students. Added to that, it is very difficult for students to confront each other for lack of participation in the project because it can create social problems and a bad atmosphere between peers. To palliate this issue, we are developing a Peer Assessment System for team projects at Concordia.
## Features
The web application will allow students to anonymously grade their team membersâ€™ performance in four distinct dimensions:
### cooperation
Actively participating in meetings; Communicating within the group; Cooperating within the group; Assisting team-mates when needed; Volunteering for tasks.
Participation and presence in meetings, cooperation on the different tasks and quality of their communication with the team
### conceptual contribution
Involvement in the discussions, quality of their research and effectiveness their ideas
### practical contribution
Contribution of the individual on the writing of the reports, the review of the documents and the overall quality and formatting of the files.
### work ethic
Overall attitude, finishing tasks before the deadline and committing to the project

The system will also feature a text field that will allow for detailed feedback that will automatically be sent to the student, this assessment will help them in future projects. 
Teachers will have access to a personalized dashboard that will allow them to create teams, add members and see the overall assessment for each member. They will be able to easily add students to the database with a csv file and can export the information for further use.
